abstract = {The Anscombe dataset is popular for teaching the importance of graphics in data analysis. It consists of four datasets that have identical summary statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, and correlation) but dissimilar data graphics (scatterplots). In this article, we provide a general procedure to generate datasets with identical summary statistics but dissimilar graphics by using a genetic algorithm based approach.},

@article{Matejka2017,
abstract = {Figure 1. A collection of data sets produced by our technique. While different in appearance, each has the same summary statistics (mean, std. deviation, and Pearson's corr.) to 2 decimal places. (x ͞ =54.02, y ͞ = 48.09, sdx = 14.52, sdy = 24.79, Pearson's r = +0.32) ABSTRACT Datasets which are identical over a number of statistical properties, yet produce dissimilar graphs, are frequently used to illustrate the importance of graphical representations when exploring data. This paper presents a novel method for generating such datasets, along with several examples. Our technique varies from previous approaches in that new datasets are iteratively generated from a seed dataset through random perturbations of individual data points, and can be directed towards a desired outcome through a simulated annealing optimization strategy. Our method has the benefit of being agnostic to the particular statistical properties that are to remain constant between the datasets, and allows for control over the graphical appearance of resulting output.},

@article{Haslett2009,
abstract = {This paper presents a simple computational procedure for generating ‘matching' or ‘cloning' datasets so that they have exactly the same fitted multiple linear regression equation. The method is simple to implement and provides an alternative to generating datasets under an assumed model. The advantage is that, unlike the case for the straight model-based alternative, parameter estimates from the original data and the generated data do not include any model error. This distinction suggests that ‘same fit' procedures may provide a general and useful alternative to model-based procedures, and have a wide range of applications. For example, as well as being useful for teaching, cloned datasets can provide a model-free way of confidentializing data.},
